Overview
--------

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations allow you to work with
the data stored inside of MongoDB.

The CRUD operation documentation is categorized in two sections:
:doc:`Read Operations </fundamentals/crud/read-operations>` and 
:doc:`Write Operations </fundamentals/crud/write-operations>`.
Read operations find and return documents stored within MongoDB.
Write operations insert, modify, or delete documents in your MongoDB
database.

Some operations combine aspects of read and write operations. See our
guide on :doc:`compound operations </fundamentals/crud/compound-operations>`
to learn more about these hybrid methods.
