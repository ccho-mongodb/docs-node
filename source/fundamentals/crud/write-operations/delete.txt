Delete a Document

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

In this section, we show you how to call the write operations to **remove**
documents from a collection in your MongoDB database.

Delete
------

If you want to remove existing documents from a collection, you can
use ``deleteOne()`` to remove one document or ``deleteMany()`` for one or
more documents. These methods accept a query document that matches the
documents you want to delete.

You can specify the document or documents to be deleted by the
``deleteOne()`` or ``deleteMany()`` write operations in a JSON object as
follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const doc = {
     pageViews: {
       $lt: 10,
       $gt: 32768
     }
   };

To delete the first matching document using the ``deleteOne()`` method or
to delete all matching documents using the ``deleteMany()`` method, pass the
document as the method parameter:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const deleteResult = await collection.deleteOne(doc);
   const deleteManyResult = await collection.deleteMany(doc);

For fully runnable examples and additional information on the available
options, see our usage examples for
:doc:`deleteOne() </usage-examples/deleteOne>` and
:doc:`deleteMany() </usage-examples/deleteMany>`.
