Overview
--------

When you connect to a MongoDB instance or deployment, you provide your
credentials and a specific authentication mechanism to the driver. The driver
negotiates with MongoDB to verify your identity using the authentication
mechanism. Once successfully connected, you can perform MongoDB commands that
your user is permissioned for.

These guides show you how to connect with the Node.js driver to a MongoDB
instance using each authentication mechanism.

The `Authentication Mechanisms <authentication-mechanisms>`_ guide contains 
sample connection code using each of the authentication mechanisms supported in
the MongoDB Community Edition which includes:

- ``DEFAULT``
- ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
- ``SCRAM-SHA-1``
- ``MONGODB-CR``
- ``X.509``

The 
`Enterprise Authentication Mechanisms <authentication-mechanisms-enterprise>`_
guide contains sample connection code using authentication mechanisms
available only in MongoDB Enterprise Edition which includes:

- ``Kerberos (GSSAPI/SSPI)``
- ``LDAP (PLAIN)``

.. note::
   For instructions on MongoDB driver installation and deployment setup, see
   our :guides:`Connect to MongoDB guide </server/drivers/>`. Select your
   deployment type and the NodeJS client.
