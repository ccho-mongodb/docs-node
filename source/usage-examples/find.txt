=======================
Find Multiple Documents
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can query for multiple documents in a collection with
``collection.find()``. The ``find()`` method uses a query document that you
provide to match the subset of the documents in the collection that match the
query. If you don't provide a query document (or if you provide an empty
document), MongoDB returns all documents in the collection. For more
information on querying MongoDB, see our
:doc:`documentation on query documents </fundamentals/crud/query-document>`.

You can also define additional query options such as
:doc:`sort </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/sort>`
and
:doc:`projection </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/project>`
to configure the result set. You should specify these options using the
cursor methods
:node-api:`sort() <Cursor.html#sort>`
and
:node-api:`project() <Cursor.html#project>`.
For detailed reference documentation, see
:node-api:`collection.find() <Collection.html#find>`.

``find()`` returns a
:node-api:`Cursor <Cursor.html>`
that provides the results of your query. Iterate through the
:doc:`cursor </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/cursor>` using cursor
methods like ``next()``, ``toArray()``, or ``forEach()`` to
fetch and work with the returned documents. If no documents match the
query, ``find()`` returns an empty cursor.

Example
-------

The following snippet finds documents from the ``movies`` collection. It
uses the following parameters:

- A **query document** that configures the query to return only
  movies with a runtime of less than 15 minutes.

- A **sort** that organizes returned documents in ascending order by
  title (alphabetical order in which "A" comes before "Z" and "1" before
  "9").

- A **projection** that explicitly excludes the ``_id`` field from
  returned documents and explicitly includes only the ``title`` and
  ``imdb`` object (and its embedded fields).

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/usage-examples/find.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent: 4

If you run the example above, you should see results that resemble the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { title: '10 Minutes', imdb: { rating: 7.9, votes: 743, id: 339976 } }
   { title: '3x3', imdb: { rating: 6.9, votes: 206, id: 1654725 } }
   { title: '7:35 in the Morning', imdb: { rating: 7.3, votes: 1555, id: 406501 } }
   { title: '8', imdb: { rating: 7.8, votes: 883, id: 1592502 } }
   ...

The ``sort`` and ``projection`` options can also be specified as methods
(``sort()`` and ``project()``, respectively) chained to the ``findOne`` method.
The following two commands are equivalent:

.. code-block:: javascript

   collection.find({ runtime: { $lt: 15 } }, { sort: { title: 1 }, projection: { _id: 0, title: 1, imdb: 1 }});
   collection.find({ runtime: { $lt: 15 } }).sort({ title: 1}).project({ _id: 0, title: 1, imdb: 1 });
